1
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:12,245
Gina!

2
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:16,199
Gina!

3
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:20,795
Where am I?

4
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:24,592
It looks as I am nowhere.

5
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:31,065
If death is like this...

6
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:33,991
it's not that nice.

7
00:13:36,154 --> 00:13:38,087
Everything had disappeared...

8
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:42,372
People, trees, 
birds in the sky, wine.

9
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:46,349
Up yours!

10
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:53,007
Dino!

11
00:13:55,111 --> 00:13:58,408
I can't even find my home.
Where am I?

12
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:29,619
Where are you, my love?

13
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,845
Why?

14
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:51,423
I will meet Horace,

15
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
Dante,

16
00:17:54,014 --> 00:17:56,014
I will converse with Petrarch,

17
00:17:58,627 --> 00:17:59,667
with Ariosto,

18
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:03,237
and with you,

19
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,959
Torquato Tasso,

20
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:11,001
My tender friend whose verses come to
my mind in this supreme moment.

21
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:13,684
Oh Death,

22
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:17,590
oh quiet in every human state.

23
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,527
Hey!

24
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:11,288
The great Mouna!
The queen of whales!

25
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:13,779
Jonas' Leviathan!

26
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:17,771
Everyone can enter.
The stomach is still warm.

27
00:20:17,982 --> 00:20:21,822
A female whale. Look at its
mouth, inviting you to go inside.

28
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:23,032
Are you afraid?

29
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:26,790
He who does not enter into its
stomach will not find the treasure.

30
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:29,182
So says the ancient Book of Wisdom.

31
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:32,930
"Come and you will see inside
its throat and farther down,

32
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:36,701
in the stomach
of the great Mouna...

33
00:20:41,486 --> 00:20:44,558
The Mouna is a door
that leads who knows where...

34
00:20:53,892 --> 00:20:55,012
Ivo Salvini...
