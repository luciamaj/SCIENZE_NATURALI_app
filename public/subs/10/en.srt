The Magic Lantern is an instrument
fo the projection of painted images

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:07,250
usually on glass, wall or screen
intentionally prepared in a dark room

3
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:09,292
with a closed box 
containing a candle,

4
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:13,250
the light of which is filtered 
through a hole with a lens.

5
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:38,500
The most ancient description of 
a Magic Lantern dates back to 1646,

6
00:00:38,557 --> 00:00:41,250
when the Jesuit priest Atanasius  
Kircher included it in his book

7
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,959
Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae.

8
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:54,083
The Magic Lantern could be used
for educational purposes.

9
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,500
It could show places, monuments, 
objects, plants, animals

10
00:00:56,626 --> 00:01:01,334
that no-one had ever seen before with 
a more impressive result than print.

11
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:14,500
The Magic Lantern, could be used
also to project fantastical images

12
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,698
as a tool for conferences and sermons,
such as damned souls among flames

13
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:20,073
and blessed souls in paradise.

14
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:42,250
At first with the Magic Lantern only
one image at a time was projected

15
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:45,167
but slowly thanks to other inventions,
in particularly Muscherboek's one,

16
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,584
it was possible to multiply the images
and make them move.

17
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:51,307
It's not rare to find in the still
existing magic lanterns

18
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:53,834
true and fantastical images together:

19
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:57,751
real and fantastical animals,
such as elephants with dragons,

20
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,834
far-away and imaginary places.

21
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,334
Eventually the invention 
of photography,

22
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:10,834
especially by Nicéphore Niépce, paved
the way for further developments.

23
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:13,834
If he had found the way to have 
before his lens a series of frames

24
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,999
he could've reproduced reality.

25
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:19,131
This will be the Lumière brothers'
winning idea.

26
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:28,429
In the Recherche, Proust talks about 
a state-of-the-art Lantern

27
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:30,987
which through superimposed panes
gave the illusion of movement,

28
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,159
showing the traitor Golo riding
towards Geneviève's castle.

29
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:39,839
The Magic Lantern show is the most
direct ancestor of film screenings,

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,779
which is nothing but the projection
of photos instead of drawn panes,

31
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:45,475
at such a speed that gives
the illusion of movement.

32
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,600
The Lantern is the pre-film device
which most reassembles a film show.

33
00:02:49,748 --> 00:02:53,204
"Wilhelm, what is the world
for our heart without love?

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,617
It's like a magic lantern without light!

35
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,640
But as soon as you introduce the lamp,
the most beautiful images appear

36
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,398
on the white wall..."
The Sorrows of Young Werther, Goethe
