1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:03,531
What do you mean?
Voices?

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:06,398
Races from one well
to the other?

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,907
Aren't you happy?

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,193
It's a great gift?
You are so lucky, Ivo Salvini.

5
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:15,726
What do they want from me?
They make fun of me.

6
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:19,144
I don't understand 
what they're saying.

7
00:00:19,238 --> 00:00:22,855
- Even better.
- I'm jealous of all your luck.

8
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:26,902
It would only bring bad luck
if you understood.

9
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:29,327
What on earth would you do then?

10
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:32,143
You only have to listen.

11
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:35,532
You just have to hear those voices.

12
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:39,204
Just hope they never get tired
of calling you.

13
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:44,040
I'm so melancholic. My poor heart
doesn't know what to think anymore.

14
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:49,923
Oh, you made me forget the most
important thing. Hold on a second.

15
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:53,505
Commercial!
