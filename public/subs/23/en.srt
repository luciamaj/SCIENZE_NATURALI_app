1
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:11,067
The famous Marquise D'Ufré,

2
00:00:11,907 --> 00:00:13,899
an extraordinary
and fascinating woman.

3
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:17,758
She adored magicians, 
people with exceptional perception.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,573
She herself was an expert
in necromancy.

5
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:24,108
No, Madam.

6
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,990
What makes you think that?

7
00:00:26,523 --> 00:00:31,045
You could overthrow
the King of France at any time.

8
00:00:32,758 --> 00:00:34,958
I would never dare.
I love France.

9
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,024
You overestimate me, my friend.

10
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:43,690
Giacomo, I beg you,

11
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:46,338
help me in the great work.

12
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:09,773
My soul
will enter the newborn's body

13
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,708
and I will no longer exist
as a woman,

14
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:17,511
but will go back to living
as a man.

15
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:19,828
A man!
