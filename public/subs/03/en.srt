1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,636
You should take care of 
such beautiful pianist hands.

2
00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:07,109
I had started to play the mandolin...

3
00:00:07,438 --> 00:00:09,790
Marisa is right.
Yours are lucky hands.

4
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:13,361
- Go away!
- You can't stay for the rehearsal.

5
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:18,181
Curiosity of knowledge
is an understandable desire,

6
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:21,986
but you cannot change fate,
what providence has established.

7
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:25,675
- Have you ever had your hand read?
- Once.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,409
This is your Mount of Venus,
sensuality.

9
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:33,119
- You must be a cheeky guy!
- If you say it...

10
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:37,284
Why are you laughing?
