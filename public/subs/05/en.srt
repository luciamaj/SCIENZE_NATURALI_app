1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:02,468
Wait...
Laugh, laugh!

2
00:00:02,508 --> 00:00:03,867
Go, Menicuccio.
One,two...

3
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:05,515
three, four!

4
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:07,711
One, two...
three, four.

5
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:09,861
Stop, enough!

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,618
What has happened?

7
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:12,992
Ready? Let's go.

8
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:15,134
No, no, no.

9
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:16,274
Ready?

10
00:00:16,915 --> 00:00:18,910
Roll! Go!

11
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:21,646
Hold my hand.

12
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:23,996
Try to be natural.

13
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:26,243
Do you believe in these things?

14
00:00:26,453 --> 00:00:28,960
You know you are guided by 
a spirit from the afterlife.

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,750
I have always told you.

16
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:33,022
But today you're a bit unhappy,

17
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:34,858
a frame in the film 
won't satisfy you.

18
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:37,055
- Let me see something.
- Please.

19
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:38,859
Let's see what happens.

20
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:43,936
- Who would you like to become?
- I want to be an actor.

21
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:47,663
- Like Cagliostro?
- Do something big.

22
00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:49,683
Try to wave "Ciao."

23
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,335
Slower, darling.

24
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:53,225
Really slow.

25
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,058
One, two, three...

26
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:57,764
And then come back.
Come back very slowly.

27
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,058
Let's try again.
And then look here...

28
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:05,135
- I need to look where you are.
- Yes.

29
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,277
When Gianni is here, look at 
my hand near his face.

30
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:11,027
Look at the rose hedge.

31
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:15,950
Flowers make those who love them
very grateful.

32
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:17,918
Look up.

33
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:21,097
She must be full of love,
to give away so much.

34
00:01:22,602 --> 00:01:23,602
Good...

35
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:24,828
Go, Gianni.

36
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,891
Keep looking at my hand.

37
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:29,710
Good...
Go, Menicuccio.

38
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:31,357
Un uomo che si prostituisce.

39
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:35,999
Che si vende alle donne 
anche se preferirebbe gli uomini...

40
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:39,691
E cosa si può dire di Gitone?

41
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:42,611
Un giorno ha indossato
una stola da donna.

42
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:44,351
L'aveva convinto sua madre.

43
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,375
Vieni, Hiram.

44
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:48,882
Vieni, Martino.

45
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:51,461
Bacia Martino...

46
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:54,637
Bacia Hiram, a sinistra.

47
00:01:57,574 --> 00:01:58,574
Coricati, Hiram.

48
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:01,839
Guarda Martino.

49
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:03,914
Vai con le mani.

50
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:06,468
Accarezza Martino.
Guardalo, Martino.

51
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,667
Coricati, Martino.

52
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:10,665
Accarezzalo, Hiram.

53
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:15,635
As disorderly as you can.

54
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,777
The crazier you can 
as if you were electrified.

55
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:22,867
Throw your arms and legs
everywhere.

56
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,530
Ready?

57
00:02:29,963 --> 00:02:32,563
Come here,
I need to give you something.

58
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:34,275
No, when things start.

59
00:02:41,564 --> 00:02:44,751
I come from a very ancient family
of actors and wizards

60
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:48,176
and, as I told you, I am a wizard.
Fellini is a wizard, too.

61
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:51,653
During the film I wanted to send him
my fluid, but he rejected it.

62
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,856
He even sent me his own
to hypnotize me.

63
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:59,129
In other words, to make me
become Grandpa.

64
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:02,284
While we were shooting
the scene in the fog,

65
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:05,547
when I am lost and scared,
Fellini kept screaming...

66
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,007
"Janigro you can't see a thing."
