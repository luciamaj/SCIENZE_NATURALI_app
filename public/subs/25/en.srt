1
00:00:00,836 --> 00:00:02,968
Camera! Action! Stop!

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,721
I am considered
an autobiographical director

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,213
and I must say that...

4
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:18,442
My autobiography
is totally invented.

5
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,541
Therefore...

6
00:00:23,012 --> 00:00:25,912
My most precise memories
are those I have put....

7
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:28,619
in my films.

8
00:00:32,526 --> 00:00:34,518
The memories of the inventions
in the film.

9
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:37,401
No, I'm not helped by a good memory.

10
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:41,458
In fact, if I were to think back...
to the first years of my life

11
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:43,683
or to my childhood and adolescence...

12
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:45,795
It can't go any faster.

13
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:47,631
..I don't remember
any particular event.

14
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:50,006
A long and sleepy brewing...

15
00:00:50,178 --> 00:00:52,201
to find myself 
inside a studio one day...

16
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:56,045
to wake up and invent
a childhood, an adolescence...

17
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:58,974
memories that in the end
were all made up.

18
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:01,272
This question
about the first years in my life

19
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:03,061
makes me very uncomfortable.

20
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:05,037
To me it's like a long motionless day.

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,137
Honestly, my true autobiography,
my true memories

22
00:01:08,162 --> 00:01:10,909
begin on the day
I first entered a studio

23
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:13,450
and I started saying,
"Camera! Action! Stop!"

24
00:01:17,757 --> 00:01:19,619
Repeat with me, "One, two..."

25
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:22,922
Whispering...

26
00:01:25,547 --> 00:01:28,555
When as child, I saw a circus
for the first time

27
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:33,671
I had the same emotions as a child
who wants to become a priest

28
00:01:33,922 --> 00:01:37,484
upon entering a church
during Elevation.

29
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:41,031
No, one, two, three, four...

30
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:46,951
I, instead, without reaching
such a zealous image

31
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:50,663
of a life made of privation
and sacrifice,

32
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:53,952
I saw a sort of Annunciation.

33
00:01:54,974 --> 00:01:56,774
Wait, you are almost there.

34
00:01:58,747 --> 00:02:00,958
The first time I saw clowns,

35
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:03,787
to me the seemed the ambassadors

36
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:06,854
announcing...

37
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:10,272
a life, a career, a calling

38
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:13,944
to which I couldn't say no.

39
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:19,026
Besides the rhetoric of this image,
it was really like this.

40
00:02:25,577 --> 00:02:28,983
The clowns
I was approached by the first time

41
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:30,772
with their grotesque masks...

42
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:34,796
They refer to,
in an unmistakable way…

43
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,147
as Saint Paul in Damascus,
I had the same revelation

44
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,101
of my profession,
of my life.

45
00:02:45,253 --> 00:02:47,683
What happened?
Ready? Let's go!

46
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,027
I have been to a boarding school
run by priests.

47
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:56,671
They were called "Carissimi"
they wore a white collar.

48
00:02:56,773 --> 00:02:59,593
I made Anita Ekberg wears
that same collar in "La dolce vita".

49
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:02,265
She is dressed like
those ancient priests.

50
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:04,428
This school was in Fano.

51
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:07,590
There was an age from 8 to 14

52
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:09,847
when you couldn't escape
boarding school.

53
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:12,605
Sarghina was,
as I tell in "Otto e mezzo",

54
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:15,472
the first overwhelming apparition
of pure sex.

55
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,863
OK!

56
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:22,216
At the time all the children
were dressed in the same suit

57
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:23,684
with gold buttons...

58
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:25,638
We gave her all our buttons.

59
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:27,599
We were very young: 7 or 8,

60
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,262
and couldn't expect anything else...
she had big bouncy boobs

61
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:34,878
and did a boisterous dance
with her big bottom.

62
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:36,837
I was traumatized.

63
00:03:36,862 --> 00:03:39,854
I was in the car with a lady,
who was driving and talking to me,

64
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:42,792
she was getting things off her chest,
I didn't understand much.

65
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:45,137
She was speaking about a divorce,
and was even crying.

66
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,270
She was driving a beautiful
convertible car.

67
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,596
I didn't understand much and showed
my sympathy through gestures.

68
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:56,986
I was looking at the skyline
and the skyscrapers.

69
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:00,809
I was leaning out from the window.

70
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,950
Then someone knocked on my head.

71
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:08,058
Next to us there was another
car with two policemen inside.

72
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:12,238
They told us to pull over.

73
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:15,639
Neither I nor the lady
had a driving licence.

74
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,612
And she didn't even have ID on her.

75
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:18,708
Really?

76
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:21,404
I said that my documents
were at the hotel.

77
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,296
I don't remember what hotel.

78
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,184
And I said my name.

79
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:27,842
There was a policeman
of Italian origin.

80
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,601
He recognized me as the director.

81
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:31,566
He said,
"That Fellini who made 'La strada'?'

82
00:04:31,632 --> 00:04:33,586
I said yes and he said...

83
00:04:37,617 --> 00:04:38,617
"That's me".

84
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:43,257
He asked me to sing
Gelsomina's trumpet tune.

85
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,035
I had to do...

86
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:52,579
a musical improvisation.

87
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:57,141
He hugged me and he made
the motorbikes escort me to the hotel

88
00:04:57,842 --> 00:04:59,724
as if I were the president
of the United States.

89
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:02,099
A very nice gesture,

90
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,630
a very nice way Americans
have to show their admiration

91
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,305
towards show business people.

92
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,049
Stop!

93
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:19,322
For me it's OK this way:
chalk white, a big mozzarella.

94
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:21,823
He will play Emperor Commodus.

95
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:24,998
Caterina, is your ankle
feeling any better?

96
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,324
Why are your eyes always red?
Put some drops in your eyes.

97
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:32,480
I have a mortifying statement
to make.

98
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,470
Going to the cinema isn't something
that comes to my mind.

99
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:41,135
It's a sort of rite or habit

100
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:47,464
that stopped to exist when I started
making films myself.

101
00:05:54,494 --> 00:05:57,658
Maybe psychoanalysis
can explain

102
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:00,213
my lack of interest.
