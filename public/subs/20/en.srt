1
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:54,342
She was the most beutiful woman
in the world.

2
00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:57,912
A ducth woman who lived upstairs
from us when I was in high school.

3
00:00:57,998 --> 00:01:00,310
Madam, let me help you,
I'll carry the bucket for you.

4
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:07,874
But I'm not a child anymore,
I'm a manager now,

5
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,530
an important, 
respected, feared man.

6
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,235
Is there someone who can translate?

7
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:14,572
Yes, me.

8
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,150
She is saying that deep inside
you are still a child.

9
00:01:26,223 --> 00:01:27,223
Doorman!

10
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:35,392
Doorman!

11
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,079
Doorman!

12
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:55,998
Exit slowly, Paolo.
Look at the lamp.

13
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:00,974
An expression that broke my heart.

14
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:02,724
Still now I feel like crying.

15
00:02:02,803 --> 00:02:05,341
Why do you keep your lion
in the basement

16
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:07,040
humiliating it, debasing it?

17
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:08,954
Come on, don't make it cry.

18
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:12,430
Sometimes pride, haughtiness
and a certain level of aggressiveness

19
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,150
can make you feel safer.

20
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,656
For instance, 
here is an abstract painting,

21
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:18,805
besides the evocative geometry

22
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:22,402
it lets you catch sight of
solid, rational structures,

23
00:02:22,546 --> 00:02:25,346
which give you a feeling of order,
protection.

24
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:28,596
The same that Banca di Roma
can give you.

25
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:33,201
Follow my advice
and your night anxiety will disappear.

26
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:38,427
I like to think I have followed
a good piece of advice.

27
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:41,722
And from now on I hope
my nights will be peaceful.

28
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:46,656
I wish you the same.

29
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,001
Good night!

30
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,091
- What do you want?
- A packet of Nazionali.

31
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:11,274
- Let me help you, Miss.
- Keep away, you're no good.

32
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:12,736
What do you mean?

33
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:15,063
I can lift 80 kilos.

34
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:18,079
- I once lifted even my dad.
- You make me laugh.

35
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,270
Eat this rubbish yourselves.

36
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:26,254
Redhead, let me go.

37
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:27,691
Let me get away.

38
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:29,447
I didn't do anything!

39
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:32,191
Stop, infamous wardens!

40
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:34,543
We're about to enter my territory.

41
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:36,855
Let's steal another car.

42
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,590
My ears are freezing.

43
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:44,346
Well, this is what I call a sausage.

44
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:50,128
I want to tell you a secret,
I want to make my brother happy.

45
00:03:51,972 --> 00:03:54,652
Donald Duck goes, "Quak, quak."

46
00:03:54,957 --> 00:03:57,566
Donald Duck goes, "Quak, quak."

47
00:03:57,683 --> 00:04:00,527
It's not Donald Duck, it's a penguin.

48
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,574
Penguin!

49
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:04,713
Penguin!
You look a bit stupid.

50
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,466
- Yes, I'm happy.
- Please.

51
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,544
A beautiful day, isn't it, Sir?
Glorious, I would say.

52
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:32,841
Quick, climb up.

53
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:36,444
Come up here.

54
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:37,748
Come on!

55
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:40,367
Look, the train is coming.

56
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:48,352
Now that I've decided to tell
my wife everything.

57
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:54,824
Help!

58
00:06:02,608 --> 00:06:05,616
The risk is very serious,
we mustn't waste time.

59
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:09,221
And the means of escape is 
not what the lady suggests.

60
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:11,170
You should become the driver

61
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:13,420
and slow down in time
to avoid catastrophe.

62
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:17,743
Dear friend, the wheel of our life
is in our hands.

63
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:23,832
Banca di Roma can help you
to find the right way.

64
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,356
What about the money?

65
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:30,870
I don't deal with financial issues,
but with psychological problems.

66
00:06:31,437 --> 00:06:33,913
Banca di Roma takes care
of everything else.

67
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:37,327
Follow my advice and your night 
anxiety will disappear.

68
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:42,010
I like to think I have followed
a good piece of advice.

69
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:45,584
And from now on I hope
my nights will be peaceful.

70
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:49,938
I wish you the same.

71
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:52,287
Good night!

72
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,652
Silvia!
What are you doing?

73
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:23,874
Marcello,
dobbiamo trovare del latte.

74
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,881
Darling, where do I find milk
at this time of night?

75
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:28,842
Da quella parte!

76
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:34,066
Silvia, where are you going
with that cat?

77
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,399
Rome is full of cats.
I will look...

78
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:37,519
Come here!
Stop!

79
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,058
Non qui, là.

80
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,559
What do you know?

81
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,260
Fulvio Lombardoni's zampone!

82
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:59,675
Come! Come!

83
00:07:59,863 --> 00:08:01,996
Zampone and lentils
for everyone!

84
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:03,181
It's all free!

85
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:05,327
Come! Come!

86
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,251
To be honest, I don't know
why I have accepted.

87
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:14,876
Perhaps to make my grandchildren happy,
they have insisted so much.

88
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:18,308
Then this myth of television,
which fascinates us all.

89
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,776
Anyway, I'm here.

90
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,199
I've always loved risking.

91
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,880
I'm not the type of person
who draws back.

92
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,966
Pippo says that the real artist 
is like a wolf.

93
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,136
When they hear 
the call of the forest...

94
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:35,321
Hey, do you want to run me over?
