1
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,464
I'm so angry I would cry?

2
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:11,730
It's disgusting, a madhouse, a circus,
the dwarfs, the transvestites...

3
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:14,840
And then what's this admiral?
I didn't understand.

4
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,948
They say he'll be acting with us.

5
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:18,629
Us, who?
Pippo did not come.

6
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:21,167
I'm crazy for pizza.

7
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:24,128
He's not here yet!
Who will I dance with, then?

8
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:27,951
He's no fool! I shouldn't 
have let you persuade me.

9
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:30,359
I knew I shouldn't have come.

10
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:32,855
I might have run away tonight,
you know.

11
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:34,992
Olive oil.

12
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:36,676
Think about it.

13
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:40,975
I’m leaving everything and
they'll have to go on without me!

14
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:49,328
And how is he doing?

15
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:51,711
Very well!

16
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:55,216
You look a little pale. How come?

17
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:57,370
See, the hotel is right here.

18
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:34,598
You are everything...

19
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,516
Do you know you are everything?

20
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:44,531
You are the first woman
in the first day of creation.

21
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,854
You are the mother, 
the sister, the lover, the friend...

22
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:51,580
the angel, the devil, 
the earth, the house.

23
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:54,190
That's what you are...
the house.

24
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:57,496
Good evening, Madam.

25
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,190
Sir...

26
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:03,189
I would like to recommend...

27
00:05:03,518 --> 00:05:05,984

00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:13,871
Marmite lyonnaise.

32
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:16,422
Soupe Colbert...

33
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:18,556

37
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:31,055
And like an echo we answer:
Barilla!

38
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:42,549
Barilla you make me always feel...
firm to the bite.

39
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,289
Say bye from me to everyone. 
Goodnight!

40
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:54,804
"The most delicious pasta
in the world."

41
00:05:55,016 --> 00:05:56,749
"Fulvio Lombardoni Pasta."

42
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,078
Put your hand on the tap!

43
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,281
Now, the sauce!
Well done!

44
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,110

I have dreamt my poor mum...

48
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:20,179
Good!

49
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:21,726
She said I would win 
a lot of money.

50
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:23,992
Yes, you have won 20 million lire.

51
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:25,766
Say hello to the mayor.

52
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:28,871
Quick, the time is almost over!
Go, go, go!

53
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:34,312
We have just awarded
someone who deserves it

54
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,495

- Damn!

57
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:05,145
Is it any good?

58
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,253
Hey, I've asked you if it's good.

59
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:10,082
Sure! What makes you 
think it isn't?

60
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:36,787
Meat costs 8 lire per kilo.

61
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:38,757
What's this world coming to?

62
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:39,859
Who knows?

63
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:43,068
They have found out
how to make money.

64
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,743
#Sailor moon,
#love is beautiful but...

65
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,118
We have brought them from home.

66
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:00,916
What do you want, urchin?

67
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:02,813
Stay seated!

68
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,910
And then we are going to eat
in Ostia.

69
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:12,836

74
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,553
Are you sure you haven't
called the wrong number?

75
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,157
Listen Maddalena, 
can I bring someone?

76
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:33,053
- Someone?
- Who's calling her in the night?
