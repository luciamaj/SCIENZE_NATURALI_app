1
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:17,259
Hello boys,
are we in trouble?

2
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:21,020
The usual financial problems?
There isn't a penny left?

3
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:24,662
Even worse, sex problems?
Don't panic, there's Mandrake.

4
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:28,358
If I touch it twice
your stick will stand up again.

5
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,080
Michela, Daniela 
come and see Marcello!

6
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:34,970
No, thanks, go to sleep.
Good night.

7
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:41,759
He keeps on looking.

8
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:44,502
You see, the film is...

9
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,079
I really want to make this film.

10
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,073
I postponed the shoot
for two weeks because...

11
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:57,771
Mezzabotta!

12
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,660
It's difficult to clarify this feeling.

13
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:05,863
It's as if for some time things...

14
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:08,543
looked at me in a strange way.

15
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:10,488
OK, snails and Valpolicella.

16
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:14,237
- Giulio, please let me take a snap.
- It isn't possible.

17
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,202
Why are you giving him
all that money?

18
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:19,014
If you want information, 
I'm always here.

19
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,499
- You're insulting me.
- What's wrong?

20
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,477
Let me come here more often.

21
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:30,954
Luisa...

22
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:32,986
Luisa, come and see me.

23
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:34,853
Just for a short while.

24
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:37,079
- When are you starting the film?
- I don't know.

25
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:38,855
Let me talk to Luisa, please.

26
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,610
And you?

27
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,130
I'm in love with you, Marcello.

28
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,704
Since when?

29
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,910
Hello sir!

30
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:03,041
My dear friends...

31
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,481
Let's have fun!

32
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,554
We are all smart people.

33
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,056
- How are you?
- Good. And you?

34
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:17,463
- It has been quite a while... years!
- Unfortunately yes, my dear.

35
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,592
Thank you! I got it.

36
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:21,861
You want to know about
my political affiliation.

37
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:26,744
Why don't you tell us what you'd
be capable of doing for an interview.

38
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:30,181
- You wish I'd write that for you?
- Oh, how awful.

39
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:32,183
I don't really remember.

40
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:35,226
How can I answer?

41
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:37,257
I'm a bit confused.

42
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,279
Can we end it here?

43
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:22,762
Marcello?

44
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:24,949
Steiner!

45
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:10,425
And yet...

46
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:23,290
Now I am really confounded.

47
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:25,823
This tower in the way...

48
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:31,050
Who knows why things
went that way.

49
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:52,865
Marcello, the cigarette, please.

50
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:55,707
I have forgotten about it.

51
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:23,864
- I don't want to go upstairs.
- It's the rule.

52
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:27,083
- And the rule is the rule.
- But Guido...

53
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:31,642
What did you do?

54
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:34,112
What did you do, 
you crazy fool?

55
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,045
Please pardon the intrusion,
Your Eminence.

56
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:52,569
But my producer is restless,
perhaps he's right...

57
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:56,420
Why does Anita need the dogs?

58
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:59,267
She is wonderful,
she looks like a gladiator.

59
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:03,957
You want to make love here?

60
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:06,105
Come on, make up something.

61
00:11:07,704 --> 00:11:09,224
I have one thousand,

62
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,188
two thousand ideas.

63
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:14,628
I can keep you locked in here 
for a week without boring you.

64
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:17,103
But you have to do everything I say.

65
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,726
You are right, you know?

66
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:30,093
There's no role in the film.
There isn't even a film.

67
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,484
There isn't anything anywhere.

68
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:37,715
Put the horse on the table
and her on the ground.

69
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,550
What has Marcello said?

70
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:41,635
Come and stand on the table.

71
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,260
This is the art I prefer,
the one that will be needed tomorrow.

72
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:47,776
A clear, precise art...

73
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,584
...without rhetoric, that doesn't lie, 
that isn't flattering.

74
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:57,394
Now I have a job that I don't like,
but I often think about tomorrow.

75
00:12:57,674 --> 00:13:01,386
- Yes, hello, thanks.
- I called you twice. Where were you?

76
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:03,408
I know. I'm sorry.

77
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:06,505
I was up in the production office.
We're working.

78
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:07,788
How are you?

79
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:10,389
A man who accepts to live like this

80
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:13,268
is a finished man,
he's nothing but a worm!

81
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:17,967
I don't believe in your aggressive,
sticky, maternal love!

82
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:21,320
I don't want it! I have no use for it!

83
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:25,022
You are always beautiful, Anita.

84
00:13:29,954 --> 00:13:32,898
I can't spend my life calling you
on the phone!

85
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:37,073
I want to work in peace!
I don't know!

86
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:39,898
Miss, could you please
shut off that music?

87
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,383
Yes... of course...

88
00:13:47,812 --> 00:13:50,079
You arrived just in time,
you know?

89
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,831
Why do you smile like that?

90
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:56,592
It was wonderful.
I'll enquire about it.

91
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:59,354
What he wrote was all true.

92
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,642
Come back here, you sick man.

93
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:03,939
- Come back.
- My mother is giving me the money.

94
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,610
- Nico.
- Marcellino!

95
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:08,132
- Bad boy Marcellino!
- How are you?

96
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:12,806
- Where are you going?
- To my fiancé’s castle...

97
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:15,839
...in Bassano di Sutri.
- Why don't you take me?

98
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,783
What do you want me to do?
I am working.

99
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:24,235
Now I bet she brings up
her husband again.

100
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:28,261
You don't think so?
You'll see, old Snaporaz.

101
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:32,189
I don't understand,
I can't hear.

102
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:39,123
- Well?
- I had to tell you.

103
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:40,276
And you did.

104
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:43,074
- Do you want me to ask her to dance?
- Yes, ask her.

105
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:45,654
Dear friends, there's just one truth.

106
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:50,548
It took me forty years to smoke
three packets of cigarettes a day

107
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:53,122
and now I am throwing away
everything.

108
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:03,151
I was friends with Steiner
but we didn't see each other often.

109
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:04,844
I don't know anything.

110
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:08,374
I really don't know anything.

111
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:13,187
So, dear Pippo... bye.

112
00:15:13,718 --> 00:15:16,726
- Amelia, at least give me a little kiss!
- Yes.

113
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:36,577
Good evening, Maddalena.
How are you? Alone?

114
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:39,855
- Would you like to dance?
- No.

115
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:41,695
Is Maddalena with you?

116
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:46,094
Personally, I like Rome very much.

117
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,256
It's sort of a moderate, tranquil
jungle where one can hide well.

118
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:55,855
I would like to perform a small 
trick in honour of our guest.

119
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,822
Mandrake's stick,

120
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:03,338
my order is immediate:

121
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:06,495
make the good old times 
come back.

122
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:14,276
Let's say you are purity itself.

123
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,260
That you are spontaneity.

124
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:21,129
But what the hell does it mean
to be really honest?

125
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,106
Didn't you hear
what the Falcaccio said?

126
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:28,008
"It's time to set symbols aside, the 
echoing of purity, innocence, escape."

127
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:34,421
I have to inform the public, it's my job.

128
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:36,523
After all,
it's just a little publicity.

129
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:40,453
You call that publicity? You got her
in trouble with her husband.

130
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:43,135
Do I worry about your being cuckolded?

131
00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:46,615
You're not a journalist.

132
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:49,560
So, let's wrap it up this way:

133
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,803
Thank you 
and see you next time.

134
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:55,087
It's cold here. 
You are nice but the place isn't...
