1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,688
Quick with the make-up!

2
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:05,093
- Is the first camera ready?
- Ready!

3
00:00:05,118 --> 00:00:07,055
- Is the second ready?
- Ready!

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,007
Everyone in their place!
Let's start!

5
00:00:13,203 --> 00:00:14,936
Further back the Bedouins!

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,781
- Sir, your helmet.
- Thank you.

7
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:20,167
The megaphone?

8
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:25,326
Everyone to their position!

9
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:28,311
Take the sunshades away!

10
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:30,202
Can I start?!

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,134
Stop! That's enough!

12
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:36,409
Stop!

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,065
Stay like that!
Ready!

14
00:00:39,518 --> 00:00:41,947
Who is that cretin?
Away!

15
00:00:42,948 --> 00:00:44,900
- You go away!
- Leave!

16
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,854
- Go away, idiot!
- Leave!

17
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:49,268
Stop!

18
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:52,018
- Stop!
- Ready!

19
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:53,503
Stop! Go!

20
00:00:58,994 --> 00:00:59,994
Take!

21
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:01,858
Take!

22
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:09,759
Do not laugh!

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,893
Do not laugh!

24
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,611
Now the beach was desert...

25
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:23,406
but we went to watch the sea anyway.

26
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:26,181
Saraghina!

27
00:01:28,376 --> 00:01:31,313
If a man came and gave you
10,000 lire, would you bathe?

28
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:34,345
I would.

29
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:36,275
- Shall we go?
- Where?

30
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,086
To see Giudizio.

31
00:01:38,214 --> 00:01:39,932
Saraghina...

32
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:41,842
Let's go, Riccardo.

33
00:01:43,422 --> 00:01:45,532
You know who Leopoldo
looks like? The priest!

34
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:57,490
I want to tell you that
many of the people you met

35
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:58,935
saved themselves.

36
00:03:59,442 --> 00:04:03,035
A seaplane has rescued
the survivors from lifeboat Aurora.

37
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:07,268
The lifeboat Stella del Nord
has miraculously reached Ancona.

38
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:11,254
Unfortunately, I have
no news from the others.

39
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,902
As far as I am concerned....

40
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:19,567
I have some great news to break...

41
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:25,266
Did you know that rhinos
give an excellent milk?

42
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:26,709
Fu Manchu!

43
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,728
Volpina!
Come here!

44
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:42,835
The wind has subsided.

45
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:46,460
Down there you see the pier.
Come and read Act IV to me.

46
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:48,859
Sir... Sergio...

47
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:52,757
- Where are you going?
- We'll find a place down there.

48
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:56,172
But it's dark down there.

49
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:58,288
Sir...

50
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:05,966
Come!

51
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,615
Are you afraid of me?

52
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:18,832
Leopoldo!
Where are you going?

53
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:20,338
I was joking.

54
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:23,169
What did you understand?
Come back, Leopoldo!

55
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:10,427
#I want to dance with you

56
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,209
#All night long like this

57
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,420
On the third day I went there
with my boat.

58
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:22,034
I whistled as usual.

59
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:26,836
The dolphin came out,
Put its head on the boat,

60
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,868
looked at me and said...

61
00:07:28,946 --> 00:07:29,946
"Mummy!"

62
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:31,071
Oh come on!

63
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:35,720
Dolphins are very intelligent,
my dentist said that too.

64
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:39,989
Look how many there are.

65
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,895
Millions and millions
and millions of stars.

66
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:46,304
My goodness...

67
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:49,759
I wonder how all that junk
can stay stuck up there.

68
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:54,577
For us it's quite easy...

69
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:59,232
If I need to construct a building,
I get the bricks and the cement.

70
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,238
But up there...
where do I put the foundations?

71
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:04,575
They are not confetti.

72
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:07,841
Surprising, my darling.

73
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:30,751
Here it comes!

74
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:32,193
Dad! Dad!

75
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:33,569
The Rex!

76
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:38,297
Long live the Rex!

77
00:08:54,237 --> 00:08:56,370
Once dead, we are a heap of dust.

78
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,705
If a bone is left,
we must watch out for the cat.

79
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:01,887
Go swimming, buy a horse
and go jumping.

80
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:05,864
But most importantly
tell your husband

81
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:08,752
to make love
more frequently.

82
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:11,018
Yes, I know, doctor.

83
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:49,458
Le prime settimane...

84
00:09:52,242 --> 00:09:54,108
sono sempre molto difficili

85
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:58,499
perché tutti i fantasmi
che si avevano per la mente

86
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,718
devono materializzarsi
e diventare oggettivi.

87
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,763
I'm going to bathe, Sir.

88
00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:10,018
Questa operazione magica...

89
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:14,302
Da Catherine la vita era felice.
A happy life reigned at Catherine's.

90
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:17,070
Il marito l'adorava.
Her husband adored her.

91
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:20,538
E i figli erano forti e laboriosi.
Her children were strong and diligent.

92
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:23,125
Tutti gli uomini del vicinato
All the men in the neighbourhood

93
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:25,093
la prendevano come esempio
set her as an example

94
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:26,296
per le mogli.
for their wives.

95
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Giulietta!

96
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,209
Please, help me!

97
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:34,895
I am old.

98
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:39,739
Besides, it concerns you.

99
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,442
I caught him.

100
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,770
Hey!

101
00:10:58,035 --> 00:10:59,035
Come down!

102
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:00,499
Come!

103
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:05,343
Help me.

104
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:07,924
Down for good.

105
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:58,213
Juliet, the lady over there
sent us this fruit basket.

106
00:11:58,276 --> 00:11:59,636
Wasn't that nice!
