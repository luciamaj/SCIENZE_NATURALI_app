1
00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:02,421
And now dear friends,
if you allow me,

2
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,671
I would like to show you
a small trick

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,067
to celebrate our beloved host.

4
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:12,274
Mandrake's stick...

5
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:15,180
To who my order may concern,

6
00:00:15,821 --> 00:00:18,899
make the good old days return.

7
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:37,018
Maya, let's make these bores
have a bit of fun.

8
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:40,478
Signora, mi permetta
Allow me, Madam.

9
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,883
Are you ready, Maya?
What am I holding?

10
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:45,703
A velvet handbag.

11
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:48,238
A white handkerchief.

12
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:50,593
A red handkerchief.

13
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:54,449
- No drugs, I hope.
- No, it's aspirin.

14
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:58,215
- A purse.
- Is there any money in it?

15
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,249
2,725 lire.

16
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:04,331
Bravo!

17
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:09,127
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're thinking, "What a trickster."

18
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:12,556
Well, sorry to disappoint you,
but there's no trick.

19
00:01:12,612 --> 00:01:13,785
No coincidence.

20
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:17,683
It's an exceptional example
of magnetic fields and telepathy.

21
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:20,979
I'll be there in a second.
You're famous now.

22
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:25,025
Cut it out.
Just tell me what's your trick?

23
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:28,820
Well, it's partly a trick,
but part of it is real.

24
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:32,242
- I don't know how, but it happens.
- Can you transmit anything?

25
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:34,842
Anything. Except for her to get lost.

26
00:01:35,418 --> 00:01:37,417
- Do you want to try?
- Yes. Wait.

27
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,853
I bet now, with you, it won't work.

28
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:41,751
Can you repeat?

29
00:01:41,848 --> 00:01:44,181
You shut up and eat your ice-cream.

30
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:47,021
It's the estimate for the spaceship.

31
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:51,661
I need to talk to you later,
face to face,

32
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:56,248
I'm at the end of my rope.
This is a madhouse!

33
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:00,171
Guido!

34
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:02,272
What does that mean?
