1
00:00:07,995 --> 00:00:10,276
One thing is building
a cinema museum...

2
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:12,940
There is already one in Italy
and it is excellent.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,948
Something else is creating a museum
dedicated to one figure, an auteur.

4
00:00:20,597 --> 00:00:26,020
In this case, 
we need to plan carefully

5
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,387
the textual and poetical
organization of this auteur.

6
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:32,551
In Fellini's case,
I think it's very clear.

7
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:36,428
Fellini started with
a very well organized textuality:

8
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:40,983
His films that had
a beginning and an ending.

9
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:44,902
But his later films no longer
contained the word "ending".

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,646
These films generally consisted

11
00:00:49,037 --> 00:00:50,920
of fragments.

12
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:53,647
When I say fragments

13
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:56,794
I mean fragments
that didn't dream their totality,

14
00:00:57,435 --> 00:00:59,661
something that often 
is the case with fragments.

15
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:04,283
These "totalities" 
were marked by the fact

16
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,315
they lacked the word "ending".

17
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:10,830
And the lack of the word "ending"
in Fellini's case

18
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:14,041
was, at the same time, an invitation
perhaps to continue

19
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:16,750
or perhaps to start all over again.

20
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:20,351
This specific nature of Fellini's work

21
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:22,522
is important for a museum.

22
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:25,826
In my opinion a museum isn't
a place where you learn,

23
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:31,311
where you organize texts with
a beginning, the first Fellini,

24
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:35,862
a development,
Fellini after "La dolce vita",

25
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:39,417
the ending,
Fellini's last film.

26
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:46,128
We don't necessarily employ
an historical criterion.

27
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,146
But not even...

28
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:50,373
a personal one.

29
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:53,895
This is a museum that must
reflect the singularity

30
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:57,807
that characterizes Fellini:

31
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,561
his more and more fragmented editing,

32
00:02:02,577 --> 00:02:06,061
which in the end
rightly lacks the word "ending".

33
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:10,787
On the other hand, this
is the answer to a question,

34
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:16,647
which is peculiar
to moving arts...

35
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:20,897
which also include theatre,
vaudeville and circus,

36
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:25,889
that is how to divide
the representation

37
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:28,374
of the museum

38
00:02:29,602 --> 00:02:32,219
and, in the meantime,
the type of reading,

39
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:35,469
implied for the visitor.

40
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,437
Therefore I would like to remind you

41
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:43,038
that the idea of going to
a Fellinian museum

42
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:47,531
to watch a Fellini film,
or maybe all his films

43
00:02:47,938 --> 00:02:51,523
is unthinkable for two reasons:

44
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,172
first of all, nowadays museums

45
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:57,568
aren't generally 
organized that way.

46
00:02:57,618 --> 00:03:02,767
And one must stay away
of this type of organization.

47
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:07,822
Secondly there is the length
of perception...

48
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:11,791
I mean the perception of
the work of art

49
00:03:12,198 --> 00:03:16,564
which entails the issue
of consumption units

50
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:19,041
as far as watching
and listening is concerned.

51
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,408
So...

52
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:25,088
Let's think about literature...

53
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,236
Or even about painting.

54
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:33,252
It's totally normal in the criticism
and teaching of literature

55
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,370
to publish collections.

56
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:38,764
In collections
you do not find the entire works,

57
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:42,803
but only parts of it.

58
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:47,415
I don't find at all strange
showing just one fragment

59
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,353
by Fellini.

60
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:53,158
I know very well that
his fragments are organized

61
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,369
in a way that gives
a certain rhythm

62
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:58,772
to the film.

63
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:01,163
But this doesn't prevent us,

64
00:04:01,718 --> 00:04:05,358
with an educational purpose,
which is typical of museums,

65
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,320
from doing something similar.

66
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:11,098
For instance, no one would ask

67
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:14,101
anybody who wants to visit
a museum on Dante

68
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,642
to read beforehand
all the "Divine Comedy".

69
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:25,409
And maybe to study the episode
about Francesca from Rimini.

70
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,515
I believe
the same can be done with cinema,

71
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:34,570
that is taking some elements 
and episode considered fundamental

72
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,308
and isolating them.

73
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,186
On the other hand,
Fellini gave permission

74
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:43,545
the day he titled one of his works
"Otto e mezzo" (eight and a half).

75
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:44,624
What is this half?

76
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:46,249
As we know....

77
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,694
"Toby Dammit" lasts 40 minutes

78
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,850
and not the usual
90-minute length.

79
00:04:57,288 --> 00:05:01,436
This idea that some episodes
can be isolated

80
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:04,483
with criteria based on criticism

81
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:07,007
is one of the reasons why,

82
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:10,842
besides the natural fragmentation
of Fellini's works,

83
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:14,502
on an educational level,
some parts can be isolated

84
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:17,471
some elements can be isolated,

85
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,484
which can be created
with different criteria.

86
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,597
In any case the museum
must think

87
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,726
about how
it can create its own reader

88
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:33,895
and give them
specific reading times.

89
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:38,840
In my opinion among these times,

90
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:42,129
there is the idea 
of constructing elements

91
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:45,929
that can exemplify situations.

92
00:05:46,398 --> 00:05:51,108
The idea is 
that a museum should offer,

93
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:54,982
in some specific areas,
a few small mind references

94
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:58,443
using things that we believe
can exemplify.

95
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,991
A museum is a place
where properties are exemplified.

96
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:08,263
From this perspective
surely the last problem is

97
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,474
to see the entire work of art.

98
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:12,809
This is unthinkable.

99
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:16,148
For this there are dedicated spaces.

100
00:06:16,765 --> 00:06:19,632
Instead we need to take samples

101
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:23,726
with the intent of illustrating.

102
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:27,194
In Fellini's case
we are particularly lucky,

103
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:31,929
as is work is made of fragments
that we can isolate some.

104
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:35,404
This is an inner criterion of the work.

105
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:38,939
From the standpoint of criticism

106
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,071
we can take from the text,

107
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:44,276
not necessarily following
the fragment criterion,

108
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:50,030
small elements exemplifying
some properties

109
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:51,789
that we want to highlight.

110
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:56,472
I would like to say something
about one of these properties.

111
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,205
This is the relation between
"The Book of Dreams"

112
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,517
and Fellini's texts.

113
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:06,206
So...

114
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,794
"The Book of Dreams" 
is very ingenuous and specific.

115
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:19,275
And it is very likely that
for many of his films

116
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:24,064
to some extent...

117
00:07:24,353 --> 00:07:26,095
dream was...

118
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:30,208
the pretext...

119
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,540
in the strong meaning
of the word "text".

120
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:34,642
The written and visual pretext

121
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,354
which was subsequently transposed,

122
00:07:37,931 --> 00:07:39,194
meaning translated

123
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:41,684
into the specific language of cinema

124
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:44,999
with music and a certain type
of spatial organization.

125
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:49,423
The problem of the daytime
treatment of dream

126
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,672
of which Fellini was one
of the greatest masters
127
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:58,412
should be looked at more carefully.

128
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:03,408
The museum is also where
this shift should be discussed:

129
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:08,775
The shift between...

130
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:14,496
on the one hand,
the dream dimension

131
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:17,609
and on the other
its visual transcription

132
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,343
without reductionism.

133
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:24,675
Without mentioning its dream source,
so to speak.

134
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:26,441
In fact, the final text,

135
00:08:28,244 --> 00:08:29,844
the one that somehow

136
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,940
in a spectacular way
in "La città delle donne"

137
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:37,035
was realized…

138
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:40,774
This final text
has rewritten dream…

139
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:45,297
to a certain extent
it completely redefined it.

140
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:51,485
The idea of showing how
dreams were first rewritten

141
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,164
through drawn images
and written texts

142
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:58,961
and then transformed,

143
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,313
this becomes, I would say,
another educational,

144
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:05,117
and also creative moment

145
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:07,042
in the museum.

146
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:08,868
Naturally...

147
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:12,775
every museum should
supply instructions.

148
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:20,928
But in the case of cinema
this is fundamental.

149
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:24,972
Not only for the large quantity
of images there is today,

150
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:30,660
within which both Fellini's cinema
and the museum are located.

151
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,386
These are images
in a universe of images.

152
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:40,965
Therefore, instructions
are particularly necessary.

153
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:45,280
Otherwise these images
end up with disappearing

154
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:52,030
in the incredible quantity of images
to which we are exposed.

155
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,655
So what are these features?

156
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:58,834
Surely the fact that
they are moving images.

157
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:01,608
And this is very important

158
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:05,275
compared to how museums
usually treat...

159
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:08,606
For instance...

160
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,236
a photography show.

161
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:14,423
The idea of moving images
is particularly important

162
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:17,028
as it is to some extent

163
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:20,073
the way in which a museum
should address

164
00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:23,601
not with the old "medium"
of the representative museum,

165
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:29,248
which we picture with images
and texts attached to walls

166
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:31,285
or paintings on the wall,

167
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,973
but that has to answer
with other moving images.

168
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,880
This idea of the translation
of images

169
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:41,672
is the fundamental point

170
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:43,029
that should...

171
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:46,969
to which visitors should be exposed.

172
00:10:47,376 --> 00:10:50,043
Visitors will surely 
come to see Fellini,

173
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:52,972
but they must be instructed

174
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,136
that this is a place where

175
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:57,317
Fellini's work is translated

176
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:03,051
by the staging
of the specific images

177
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,809
by Studio Azzurro.

178
00:11:04,878 --> 00:11:07,478
Moreover, in this case
we find ourselves

179
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:12,073
before a different quality
of the images.

180
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,174
How can I say...

181
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:16,909
of their expression.

182
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:20,249
These are images
from new technologies.

183
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:22,117
It is clear that

184
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:25,625
the shift from technology
to technology

185
00:11:25,837 --> 00:11:27,517
requires instructions.

186
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:31,739
This also means that

187
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:35,020
the museum
has an enormous responsibility.

188
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,109
It doesn't just illustrate something

189
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:40,578
as we once said.

190
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,684
But it has to translate something.

191
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,430
This translation, which isn't
a translation in the literal sense:

192
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:51,676
from word to word,

193
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:55,242
but from a type of image
to another type of image,

194
00:11:55,836 --> 00:11:58,145
from images made in a certain way

195
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,609
to images made with new technologies.

196
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:10,763
Clearly they expose visitors
to types of experience

197
00:12:11,223 --> 00:12:12,654
that are very different.

198
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:17,595
The other thing is the need
in this translation,

199
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,843
which is typical of the dissemination 
role characterizing museums...

200
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,500
In this case, though,
dissemination is not possible

201
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,307
if it betrays the nature of...

202
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:36,188
the work of art.

203
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:40,742
It's impossible to transform a Fellini
film into a series of photographs

204
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:44,401
of his characters
or of frames from his films.

205
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:47,636
To some extent this is
a retranslation...

206
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,042
with a medium
which is previous to cinema.

207
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:56,519
The other need is for the translation

208
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,987
not only to disseminate knowledge

209
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:05,792
but also to recreate Fellini's work.

210
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,839
I mean, to some extent,
Studio Azzurro is responsible

211
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:14,560
for being not only the dissemination
of Fellini's discourse,

212
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,355
something that visitors could expect,

213
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:22,469
but also for rewriting,

214
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:27,612
for reimagining Fellini's discourse,

215
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:30,501
which can have its independent quality

216
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:33,112
from a point of view of
the style and the beauty.

217
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:34,941
As Fellini rightly said,

218
00:13:35,643 --> 00:13:37,323
it's not just his work…

219
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:41,409
Fellini
is something like Fellinism,

220
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:44,641
the adjective "Fellinian",

221
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,142
as Fellini stressed.

222
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:54,989
Fellini is also all the conversations,
texts, images, people

223
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:58,981
that surrounded him

224
00:13:59,844 --> 00:14:03,982
and of which the museum
shouldn’t get rid.

225
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
I believe they are part of Fellini

226
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,950
and they seeped deeply
into his work.

227
00:14:13,411 --> 00:14:15,699
And exited from his work

228
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:18,097
in the form of words, styles
life styles...

229
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:22,566
a way which is Fellinian.

230
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:29,433
How does the museum 
relate to this aura...

231
00:14:32,377 --> 00:14:35,501
of chats

232
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:37,540
and gossip

233
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:41,650
of information about life styles

234
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:44,807
that cinema has represented?

235
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:50,623
How does the museum tackle
the issue of the Fellinian life style,

236
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:57,853
the one he,
willingly or not, proposed

237
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:03,587
and to which is also partly due
his reputation?

238
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:07,400
I think there two ways
of doing it.

239
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,020
One is studying it

240
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:14,361
and maybe it would be interesting
if the museum became

241
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:16,649
a place of proposition,

242
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:23,034
not only of research on
the quality and variety of his work.

243
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:26,891
But also on the way
how cinema as a medium

244
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:33,610
succeeded in creating this sort
of textual semiotic universe

245
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:38,324
that surrounds the work
and the figure of Fellini.

246
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,660
How do we go about it?

247
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:42,161
I believe that...

248
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:45,730
there is a strategy
from this point of view:

249
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,692
that is, witnesses.

250
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:58,105
In Fellini's case
most of the people interviewed

251
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:04,738
rarely describe episodes
about Fellini's work,

252
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,119
they tell us about episodes
of his life,

253
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:11,243
of the life...

254
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,520
of the Hollywood moment
in Cinecittà,

255
00:16:16,151 --> 00:16:19,041
of personal relationships....

256
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,698
I think this should
be taken into account.

257
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:27,397
And the museum should be
a place of promotion

258
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,906
o the reconstruction of the memory
of a specific life style.
