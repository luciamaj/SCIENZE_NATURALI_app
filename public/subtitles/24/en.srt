1
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,252
"A nun who has seen you for
two months at the convent Mass,

2
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:19,503
wishes to meet you."

3
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:23,317
"She will be waiting for you
at San Bartolo island tonight."

4
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,804
"Without a servant,
and carrying a candle."

5
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:29,312
Is it gold?

6
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:31,987
What bird is that?

7
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:34,829
A dove or an owl?

8
00:01:05,257 --> 00:01:06,617
It is an offense.

9
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:10,645
When do two lovers, overtaken
by frenzy, worry about manners?
