1
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,020
This way, Adele...

2
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:41,417
I'll take her out, Madam.

3
00:00:59,263 --> 00:01:01,935
When are you showing "The Vale
of Love" with Gary Cooper?

4
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:03,351
Next week, my love.

5
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,270
Thanks a lot.

6
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:08,483
When can your little prince
sleep with you?

7
00:01:08,658 --> 00:01:10,925
You'll get my purse over your head!

8
00:01:13,517 --> 00:01:14,637
Such behaviour!

9
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:19,387
Get lost, Giudizio.

10
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,808
It was beautiful!
I had a good cry!

11
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:27,688
Open up, good lord!

12
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:33,715
18...

13
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,247
- 18?
- Campari!

14
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:40,100
- Aldina, wanna know who it was?
- We know. It was Campari

15
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,525
I met him in the race at Monza.

16
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,752
Lallo!

17
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:13,166
Watch out, Lallo!

18
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:14,833
Well done, Lallo!

19
00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:17,376
- What is it, Lallo?
- An ear!

20
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:19,554
Look, an ear!

21
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:39,930
Where's Ronald Colman?
I don't see him.

22
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:41,271
Gradisca!

23
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:43,294
Hurray for Gradisca!

24
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:47,477
Where are all these people going?

25
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:51,436
Where are they going
with hearts pounding?

26
00:02:51,643 --> 00:02:52,643
Watermelon!

27
00:02:53,135 --> 00:02:54,539
Ice creams!

28
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:58,088
Today is a very important day
for our country, for the fatherland.

29
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:00,245
Come on, we're off!

30
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:52,316
Against the palate,
like this.

31
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:54,872
And then spit it out.

32
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:58,308
Try!

33
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,335
"There will come a day...

34
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,272
"when a renewed Italy

35
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:10,336
"will take to the field of battle
on her own behalf

36
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,020
"and not to defend her soil..."

37
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:13,629
This is the Rubicon...

38
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:18,458
The river that Julius Caesar crossed
and said...

39
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:21,939
Take your shoes off...

40
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:23,231
Shoes off!

41
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:25,240
And let's cross it together.

42
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,315
- To Rome!
- To Rome!

43
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:37,957
One, two, three, four...

44
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:41,878
One, two, three, four...

45
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:46,055
One, two, three, four...

46
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:51,029
five, six, seven, eight....

47
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:54,735
One, two, three, four...

48
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:58,444
These youth are sturdy as rock.

49
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:00,028
I agree.

50
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,065
One, two, three...

51
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:10,655
four, five, six, seven...

52
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:18,772
Hail Duce!

53
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,979
- Who locked the gate?
- I did.

54
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:23,801
- Why?
- You know why.

55
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:25,002
Unlock it.

56
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:28,327
Listen to the racket they've been
making in the piazza all day.

57
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:30,803
Open up.
I have business to take care of.

58
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:31,931
Nothing doing.

59
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,370
You're staying at home.
Take off this stuff!

60
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:38,875
If I want to be a widow, I'll
strangle you with your neckerchief!

61
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:40,081
Look!

62
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,156
Think I'm scared
of those black-shirted lice?

63
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:45,028
Give me the key.

64
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,980
Give me the key!

65
00:05:47,284 --> 00:05:48,284
Miranda!

66
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:49,665
Damn it all!

67
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:53,831
Why is it that
whenever there's a f*****g rally,

68
00:05:56,316 --> 00:05:59,188
she locks me in?
This is the last straw!

69
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:08,775
Ninety-nine per cent
of the population are party members.

70
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:12,389
We have 1,200 Young Fascist boys,
3,000 Young Fascist girls....

71
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:16,246
Our Fascist hearts beat as one,

72
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:18,611
but we should speed up the works
on the seafront.

73
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:23,396
This marvellous enthusiasm makes us
young and yet so old at the same time.

74
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:27,349
Young, because Fascism
has rejuvenated our blood

75
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:30,084
with glowing ideals
from ancient times.

76
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:33,727
All I can say is
Mussolini's got two balls this big!

77
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:47,177
Hey!

78
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,750
He's up there!

79
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:27,922
The fascist shit, his head is split

80
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:31,769
Crossed the Rubicon one day
and lost his balls along the way

81
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:40,148
Children, do you like Mussolini?

82
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:43,026
Julius Caesar salutes
with his hand...

83
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:45,727
Don't be an arsehole,
go and see Mom.

84
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:48,170
Do you think I am mad?
Stay calm!

85
00:08:50,306 --> 00:08:51,586
Get your lottery tickets here.

86
00:08:58,675 --> 00:08:59,795
Dragoni Hotel!

87
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:04,643
Pictures of the city of cinema,

88
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:08,810
which, for its perfect
facilities and services,

89
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:12,142
and for its impressive buildings
and studios

90
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:15,206
among which 9 perfectly isolated
stage theatres from outside noise,

91
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,689
has become a model in its own rights.

92
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:40,757
Don't laugh!
Step, hip...

93
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:45,878
Ladies, gentleman, comrades...

94
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:48,771
Cinema is young.

95
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:52,784
We were born
just after silent films.

96
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:57,244
We have witnessed
the triumph of sound.

97
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:00,735
We will witness the triumph
of colour.

98
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,269
Enough!

99
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:04,445
Stop!

100
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:06,806
Stop!

101
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,150
Cesare, I was thinking...

102
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:20,992
What?

103
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:24,176
Why don't you stuff it up your arse?

104
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,746
- What do you want?
- Who is it? Who is it?

105
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:34,138
Do you think
there will be a war?

106
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:38,999
- Want to see the little granny?
- Sure. That's why I came.

107
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:40,049
Follow me.

108
00:10:40,822 --> 00:10:42,622
She's littler than us kids.

109
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:48,397
I refuse to believe that the people
of Great Britain, always friends,

110
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,774
feel it their duty to lead Europe
into a catastrophe...

111
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:54,968
by defending an African nation.

112
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:56,925
The resemblance is frightening.

113
00:10:56,965 --> 00:10:59,980
Universally branded and without
the shadow of any kind of civilization

114
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:04,023
against this nation of heroes,
artists, poets, saints, navigators...

115
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:06,174
..a resolute hostile attitude.

116
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:16,748
- Yes, let's go...
- Yes, let's go...

117
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Yes, let's go...

118
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,625
Hottie!

119
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:42,520
My love! My angel!

120
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,620
Golden bum!

121
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:50,766
Isn't this the siren?

122
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:53,041
There's the alarm.

123
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:55,411
There's the alarm.

124
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:04,136
The audience must reach
the air-raid shelter

125
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:07,337
at street number 104.

126
00:12:09,046 --> 00:12:10,326
Whose is the baby?

127
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,743
Who gave me this child?

128
00:12:13,268 --> 00:12:14,268
Stay there.

129
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:15,872
Light!

130
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,204
Attilio!

131
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:31,418
Want to come and rest at mine?

132
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:33,564
My hotel is close.

133
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,363
They won't bomb us
as long as the Pope's in Rome.

134
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,580
Good night, Anita.

135
00:12:39,838 --> 00:12:41,905
You might as well say good morning.

136
00:12:42,155 --> 00:12:45,401
- What's that booming?
- They're bombs!

137
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:54,259
Help me!

138
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:56,684
They are bombing us!

139
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Help!

140
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:01,872
Second air raid on Rome
covered by our cameramen.

141
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:06,917
The war hurricane hits also the homes

142
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:11,584
in the Prenestino, Casilino, Appio,
San Lorenzo, Pta Maggiore districts...

143
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:16,337
The city is covered
by a blanket of death.

144
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:41,101
For the fifth time the anniversary
of the Italian Republic:

145
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:43,106
the parade starts in the sky.

146
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:45,845
The applauses are silenced
by a fanfare.

147
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:22,565
Honourable colleagues,
the Chamber of Deputies

148
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,966
has instructed us
to investigate and gain

149
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:29,879
statistical, economic, legislative
information

150
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:31,845
for the war against poverty.

151
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,685
In fact, everybody knows
that poverty is a problem,

152
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:39,707
but few know
its most distressing side.

153
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:22,244
At a stone's throw from the Coliseum
there was the Domus Aurea,

154
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:24,308
a luxurious imperial dwelling.

155
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:27,673
Now its ruins are a shelter
for the refugees.

156
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:31,220
Once again the stone cubicles
are beds for the offspring of man.

157
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:34,459
Sometimes what is temporary
becomes final

158
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:37,538
and those who had to live
in these houses for a few month

159
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:39,854
ended up with staying for years.

160
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,426
Madam...

161
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:55,037
Why did you move
to the suburbs?

162
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:58,509
- Where did you use to live?
- In San Lorenzo.

163
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:01,347
- You moved because of the bombings?
- Yes.

164
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,528
Would you like a new house?

165
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,208
You bet I would like one.

166
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:10,200
I've ben sleeping for 18 years 
in a disgusting two bed room.

167
00:16:11,978 --> 00:16:13,711
They're giving us  a home.

168
00:16:14,168 --> 00:16:15,168
Yes, a home.

169
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:17,960
They've been saying it for ages.

170
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:20,548
- I applied two years ago...
- Good morning, sir.

171
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:21,763
Good morning.

172
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,135
Thank god you are here.
My nane is Antonio Scioni.

173
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:26,561
I applied for a home
14 months ago.

174
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:28,272
Rome is growing.

175
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:31,620
New districts are built
on the suburbian meadows.

176
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:35,945
And yet shacks like this one
seemed a feat years ago

177
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:39,485
when they replaced even more
makeshift dwellings.

178
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:02,573
This is the new Tormancia,
a suburb of Rome,

179
00:17:02,598 --> 00:17:04,685
its no longer means "bad life".

180
00:17:05,122 --> 00:17:07,518
The people in Primavalle
are celebrating.

181
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:09,122
You will have a home.

182
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,019
Entire districts are rising
in the suburbs

183
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:13,727
designed with rational modern criteria

184
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:16,909
and bound to host decently
and comfortably

185
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:19,068
a great deal of homeless people.

186
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:21,611
It's all new, all renovated:

187
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,674
bridges, arches, viaducts...

188
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:26,204
It's started and it runs fast
our rebirth.

189
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:29,836
We are building stone by stone
this Italy ground by war.

190
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,903
Workers...

191
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:39,156
Workers from the plain...

192
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:45,441
- What's wrong with this car?
- Why are you stopping?

193
00:17:45,624 --> 00:17:47,370
Open the bonnet.

194
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,500
Hey, they're coming.

195
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,133
We were joking.

196
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:53,362
Run!

197
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:58,695
- What happened?
- Alberto! Riccardo!

198
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:01,284
I was sleeping.

199
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:04,344
I was them.
I was asleep. I am a socialist.

200
00:18:08,092 --> 00:18:12,232
The giving a new destination
to the Universal Exhibition in Rome.

201
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:15,756
These buildings will become a model
of model city-planning and culture.

202
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:19,994
Silence will cease in these places.

203
00:18:58,929 --> 00:18:59,929
Marcello?

204
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:02,699
Marcello? 
What do I have to do now.

205
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:07,122
Put the horse on the table
and the heron the ground.

206
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:12,145
Come here and stand on the table.

207
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:15,103
I'm coming.

208
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,256
Shall I pick you up at 8 pm?

209
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,764
- You are playing difficult to catch.
- I'm working.

210
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,909
Rome is an extraordinary city

211
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:42,349
and it is understandable that and
extraordinary world such as cinema

212
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,754
has chosen as its capital
this city,

213
00:19:44,888 --> 00:19:47,340
which has seen so many 
extraordinary events and things.

214
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:50,603
Postwar Italian cinema 
is a worldwide phenomenon.

215
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:54,142
Our film industry is thriving.

216
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:58,091
Belinda Lee is arriving from London.

217
00:19:58,227 --> 00:20:00,845
And here's BB
followed by Rock Hudson.

218
00:20:05,848 --> 00:20:06,848
The glasses!

219
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:20,445
The diva is accompanied through customs.

220
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:22,652
Her fans are waiting to welcome her.

221
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,470
You look so fresh.

222
00:20:40,117 --> 00:20:44,405
- Your friends are ready to attack.
- Marcello, where are you going?

223
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:47,753
- Miss Maddalena!
- Please, leave me alone tonight.

224
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:51,311
Welcome back. Here she is.
More photogenic than a star!

225
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:54,834
Every night the same story.
Don't they ever get bored?

226
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:56,739
Paparazzo, enough!

227
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,338
She'll eat you alive!

228
00:20:58,363 --> 00:21:00,672
You should be used to it by now.
You're a public figure.

229
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:03,346
Marcello, where are you going?
Tell us where you are taking her.

230
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:20,967
The festival has ended.

231
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:22,683
There are many 
useless controversies:

232
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:24,745
Wilma will have to make do 
with rock 'n roll.

233
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:28,170
No latin or maths: 
this is what youth studies today.

234
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:45,091
Ruggero?

235
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,510
Ruggero, are you serious?

236
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:50,763
You're not a sport.
You don't deserve a woman like this.

237
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:57,551
And now, Nadia, take off the stole!

238
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:05,863
Together with films that keep
the quality of Italian films very high,

239
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:13,316
other films relied on sexual 
or porn innuendoes.

240
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:18,856
I wish to repeat 
that gratuitous volgarity,

241
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:21,657
continuous offence to public decency,

242
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:23,993
pornography for its own sake

243
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:27,369
cannot and will not 
from now on tolareted.

244
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:32,832
Shame on you!

245
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,493
It's a deadly sin.

246
00:22:36,942 --> 00:22:39,475
I cannot believe it,
it's not possible.

247
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:52,759
Good morning.

248
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:37,768
In the glory of St Peter the Second
Ecumenical Council has started.

249
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:43,008
3000 bishops from everywhere reach 
the greatest temple of Christianity.

250
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:02,314
Once again from the TV cameras
in Piazza San Pietro

251
00:24:02,701 --> 00:24:05,876
the believers will see 
the Saint Father's blessing figure

252
00:24:06,424 --> 00:24:09,336
sent through those waves,
which have something spiritual.

253
00:24:10,844 --> 00:24:12,756
Here they are!
Go as high as you can.

254
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:16,284
As soon as they get to the tree,
get a nice dolly shot.

255
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,740
Silence!

256
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:24,228
The Madonna said that if you don't 
build a church she won't come anymore.

257
00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:26,277
Good night! Go home!

258
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:09,677
Listen, I see that you have
a wonderful Morandi.

259
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,599
Yes...

260
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:13,908
He's my favourite painter.

261
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:16,511
The objects are flooded
with a wistful light

262
00:25:16,686 --> 00:25:20,012
and yet painted with such
a detachment, precision, rigor...

263
00:25:20,814 --> 00:25:23,798
President Gronchi inaugurates
the 8th Rome Quadriennale.

264
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:28,012
This is the map of the 30th Venice 
Biennale which opened in these days.

265
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,298
Figurative and abstract art
are now juxtaposed.

266
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:33,980
And critics will express
their opinion.

267
00:25:56,783 --> 00:25:58,529
..I've been paying everything 
for month.

268
00:25:58,736 --> 00:26:01,469
If you don't make the film,
I'll ruin you.

269
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:04,544
What's wrong in your life,
Mr. Dammit?

270
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:12,595
Is it true you have done
the most menial obs?

271
00:26:26,742 --> 00:26:30,202
The war between TV and cinema
becomes tougher mand tougher.

272
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,581
The Italian TV 
has hit the bull's eye.

273
00:26:35,913 --> 00:26:38,642
The stake is 2 million and 560 thousand
lire.

274
00:26:39,143 --> 00:26:41,071
I want to know if you want
to leave or double.

275
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:43,460
Let's find another hard sound

276
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,833
and with the print fonts

277
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:50,207
let's he how we can  match it 
with an animal name.

278
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,158
Think it over for awhile.

279
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,803
Repeat this horizontal movement 
of the eyes...

280
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,890
Look, Madam!

281
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,930
Look what Elisabetta is doing.

282
00:27:01,073 --> 00:27:03,673
You mustn't move the head,
ust the eyes,

283
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:04,931
Wait a minute!

284
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:06,779
Like this.

285
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:11,623
Faster and faster.

286
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,707
With an excavator today 
and some ground tomorrow

287
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,450
that's how new roads
are built in Italy.

288
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:21,476
Silently the Motorway of the Sun
is becoming a reality.

289
00:27:21,651 --> 00:27:25,222
When the great plan of roads 
and motorwways will be realized

290
00:27:25,262 --> 00:27:28,590
our country will have 
a great communication network.

291
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:31,961
- Overtake, Marcello.
- Stop it.

292
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,820
Don't you see there's a traffic jam?

293
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:36,754
Overtake.
Run him over.

294
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:42,321
Thee last hectic works in Rome,

295
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:45,639
which is now ready to host people
from all over the world

296
00:27:45,718 --> 00:27:48,163
who are coming for 
the 17th Olympic Games.

297
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:50,623
The first four road tunnels
are opening

298
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:54,290
and their convenience and usefulness
have already turned out to be great,

299
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:26,505
In the Capitol Square a new chapter 
of the marathon legend is beginning.

300
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,475
At mile 12 only two runners
are leading.

301
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:31,723
And the second is Abebe Biikila.

302
00:28:31,996 --> 00:28:34,940
For them the gates of the city
are lighting up?

303
00:29:16,193 --> 00:29:19,329
When will all the underground
network be finished?

304
00:29:22,765 --> 00:29:25,098
"Underground" for Rome
is  bad word.

305
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:26,820
A word full of question marks.

306
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:29,129
Here where the first underground
station will be built,

307
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:30,613
we understand why.

308
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:33,725
The drill has found 
new archeological exhibits.

309
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:35,092
Stop the drill!

310
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:13,938
Who am I?

311
00:30:31,572 --> 00:30:33,572
Good morning.
Do you live here?

312
00:30:33,913 --> 00:30:36,857
So far, yes.
We celebrated a wedding yesterday.

313
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:38,913
The crickets were our orcherstra.

314
00:30:39,096 --> 00:30:43,896
In Trinita' dei Monti the stairway and
the fountain are invaded by hippies.

315
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:47,008
They come from Italy and broad
and camp here.

316
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:50,552
Citizens are outraged,
the police sometimes intervene

317
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:53,222
but these unique champions
of the protest are irremovable.

318
00:31:04,093 --> 00:31:07,357
These disenchanted youths
hug together like puppies,

319
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:08,474
like chicks.

320
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:10,236
Love isn't...

321
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:14,247
Clear the square.

322
00:31:15,077 --> 00:31:17,116
Why who are we bothering?

323
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:18,870
Clear! Clear!

324
00:31:19,014 --> 00:31:21,914
I'm not bothering anyone:
you cannot beat me!

325
00:31:24,498 --> 00:31:26,458
Dear Madam, these are dirty vagrants.

326
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:29,336
Their only thought
is to make love.

327
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:33,936
Don't be scared: they aren't
doing anything to them.

328
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:56,347
Music is a means
of exploitation!

329
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,373
Worse than in the factory!

330
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:04,114
#We are many
#We are more than half

331
00:32:06,165 --> 00:32:08,898
#And we have always been
#part of mankind

332
00:32:10,449 --> 00:32:12,036
#We are many
#We are more than half

333
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:17,182
#Amd we don't count anything
#in this society

334
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:22,597
Sisters, watch out, a man,
a male haunts us

335
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:24,758
He listens to our conversations

336
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,750
Steals our words

337
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,017
Records our speeches
and broadcasts them reditied

338
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:31,996
He is spying us.

339
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:33,846
We must stop him,

340
00:32:34,073 --> 00:32:35,193
look for him, block him.

341
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,320
Throw him out.

342
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,170
Sorry...

343
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:54,612
There he is,
it's him.

344
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,444
Look, evertything is falling.

345
00:33:08,757 --> 00:33:09,757
Help!

346
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:43,451
Berzot didn't play well.

347
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:57,231
My heart is bursting.

348
00:33:57,924 --> 00:34:00,932
Madam, there aren't 
any players today in Italy.

349
00:34:01,012 --> 00:34:02,692
All they want is money.

350
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:05,294
I want a picture with Gullit.

351
00:34:06,305 --> 00:34:07,425
Me and Gullit.

352
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,930
Is it OK here?
Come on!

353
00:34:15,485 --> 00:34:18,018
Silvio Berlusconi, from Milan,
aged 49.

354
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:21,564
Classical examples of
self-made man.

355
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:25,664
Critics have objections on the value
of his TV programmes.

356
00:34:27,016 --> 00:34:30,536
But he answers convinced 
that they have cultural value.

357
00:34:30,865 --> 00:34:34,641
We are happy to say goodbye with
our password: Spritz Sugo.

358
00:34:36,198 --> 00:34:37,998
And life becomes a Paciugo.

359
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:14,158
Let's welcome, by applauding him,
a men who's really in love.

360
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:23,565
It's the retreat sign,
let's go.

361
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:31,496
TV addicted!

362
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,677
Here are the infamous spots

363
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:43,613
interrupting systematically
shows, news programmes and films.

364
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:46,320
Private televisions broadcast them
inceessantly.

365
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:49,863
The war has been declared from cinema
to private TVs,

366
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:51,694
It's dawn.

367
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:54,485
They will attack noww.

368
00:36:04,677 --> 00:36:05,877
There they are.

369
00:36:06,257 --> 00:36:07,257
It's them.

370
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:01,819
- Did you like it?
- Yes, very good.

371
00:37:06,382 --> 00:37:09,151
- How dit it go?
- How do I know.

372
00:37:09,779 --> 00:37:11,059
He siad, "Stop."

373
00:37:11,215 --> 00:37:14,183
- Do we have to come back tomorrow?
- I have just told you it's over.

374
00:37:14,374 --> 00:37:15,654
Merry Christmas!

375
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:43,023
Enough now!

376
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,660
Long live, gnocchi!

377
00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:22,516
Mandrakes's stick

378
00:38:23,473 --> 00:38:25,153
my order is immediate

379
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:28,205
Make the good old days come back!

380
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:59,145
Can you see studio 5
from that height?

381
00:39:00,258 --> 00:39:01,858
Maurizio, answer me!

382
00:39:02,226 --> 00:39:03,426
Heres studio 5!

383
00:39:03,853 --> 00:39:05,720
It's wonderful from up here.

384
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:08,493
We can also see the aqueduct.

385
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,620
And the Tuscolana Road.

386
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:14,156
But everything is trembling.

387
00:39:15,932 --> 00:39:18,702
Now you should focus
on the sound.

388
00:39:20,202 --> 00:39:22,535
The megaphone
isn't working anymore.

389
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:24,287
The batteries are dead.

390
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,670
Take 1!
