1
00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:02,079
Bats!

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:04,702
- Eugenio, how stupid.
- Cristina makes me laugh.

3
00:00:04,788 --> 00:00:05,788
It isn't true.

4
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:07,865
- Are you working?
- Yes.

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,639
Dimmi chi sei.

6
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:13,756
Who do you want
to communicate with?

7
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:16,041
I feel some energy...

8
00:00:16,157 --> 00:00:18,618
Countess, keep the contact.
Don't laugh!

9
00:00:18,642 --> 00:00:20,002
I'm not laughing.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,333
Why don't you leave me alone?

11
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:25,629
Please, go away.

12
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,418
- Call Sister Edvige!
- Who is she?

13
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:31,658
It's a nun that in the summer,
walks around here...

14
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:34,007
...carrying her head on a dish.
- Yeah, right.

15
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:35,528
She is drunk.

16
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,185
Blow out the candles!

17
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:43,598
Who are you?
Who do you want to communicate with?

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,387
Giulio, it's a message for you.

19
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:50,609
Where are you?

20
00:00:52,862 --> 00:00:57,947
Sometimes I think,
"There must be a place in the world

21
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:04,631
"where there's a hole, an opening,
to the other side?"

22
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:45,103
In Paris, the Marquise D'Ufre's salon
was the one most sought after,

23
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:48,107
by every outstanding person
of art and culture.

24
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:51,380
I met Count Saint-Germain,

25
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:55,922
a magician who practiced occultism,
who I considered without scruples.

26
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,222
I am in contact
with the Queen of Saba.

27
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:12,076
Oh, how kind!
She has returned to us.

28
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:16,548
What is the water that does not
come from the rocks,

29
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:18,752
that does not fall from the sky,

30
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:24,832
that does not come from the earth?
Answer, the sweat of a horse.

31
00:02:24,888 --> 00:02:28,984
They are the enigmas of Salomon.
That is his answer to the queen.
