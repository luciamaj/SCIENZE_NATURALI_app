1
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:15,884
Giacomo!

2
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:21,754
Don't you recognize me?

3
00:00:22,465 --> 00:00:25,198
I have recognized you
immediately, stupid!

4
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:28,405
Mother!
It's really you!

5
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:32,327
- I knew you were in Saxony...
- What are you doing here?

6
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:34,532
I am here on business.

7
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:38,135
For a project that the minister
is very interested in.

8
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:42,106
An excellent project, I must say.
An excellent occasion.

9
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:45,263
I see, the usual fables,
the usual nonsense.

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,962
You never send a cent
to your poor, old mother!

11
00:00:51,697 --> 00:00:54,030
I did not know your address,
Mother!

12
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:56,688
- You never know anything!
- It is true!

13
00:00:56,713 --> 00:01:01,087
I wanted to write to you,
visit you sometimes, but...

14
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:05,026
I could come and stay with you
for a few days.

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,496
If my business allows me to...

16
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:08,913
But I hope so.

17
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:11,849
You want to come to my place
and live with me?
