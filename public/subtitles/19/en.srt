1
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:06,259
#Happy and blissful
#from great love

2
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:08,805
#cuckolded by great love

3
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,155
Blocked! You cannot go beyond.

4
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,519
But we must find the way out.

5
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:01,913
Be we...

6
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,968
in our conscious life

7
00:02:04,203 --> 00:02:06,522
with as much intellingence
as imagination...

8
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:09,382
we must organize 
at best our defence.

9
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,621
I think that...

10
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:13,834
Banca di Roma...

11
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:17,382
could be an excellent protection.

12
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:19,445
Sorry, but the money?

13
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,423
I don't deal with financial issues,
but with psychological problems.

14
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,407
Banca di Roma takes care
of everything else.

15
00:02:25,556 --> 00:02:30,993
Follow my advice and your night
anxiety will disappear.

16
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:36,902
I like to think I have followed
a good piece of advice.

17
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:40,211
And from now on I hope
my nights will be peaceful.

18
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:42,279
I wish you the same.

19
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,039
Good night!

20
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:00,911
- Gabriella, pleased to meet you.
- They have 11 fruit tastes.

21
00:03:01,693 --> 00:03:04,349
Some customers would like 
tuna and onion taste.

22
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,753
But I don't think it's a good idea.

23
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:10,067
Two hemispheres, the first tastes like
peach, the other one like apricot.

24
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:12,896
It's a matter of tastes.
The lover chooses...

25
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:15,247
Don't move, darling!

26
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,341
..bites...

27
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
..chews...

28
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:20,515
It's all good stuff.

29
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:23,650
Once he gets excited, he feels...

30
00:03:23,757 --> 00:03:27,905
We are planning to add some drugs.

31
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:40,733
There are three screenings.
Come back later.

32
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:41,959
The change?

33
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:54,713
And yet...

34
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,851
You are so pretty!

35
00:04:07,234 --> 00:04:08,898
I've been wanting to meet you
for so long.

36
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:09,969
Me too.

37
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,378
You are so elegant!

38
00:04:18,397 --> 00:04:21,061
"What's the meaning of the girl
from the spring?

39
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:24,563
"An offer of purity?
Of warmth to the protagonist?

40
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,338
"Of all your story's overabundant
symbols, this is the worst...

41
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:29,623
"filled with..."
